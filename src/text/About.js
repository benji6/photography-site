      p: "Fine Art Photographer currently enrolled in my final year at Falmouth University studying BA (Hons) Photography. My interest in this medium began at the age of fourteen when I received my first camera, but peaked when I discovered the darkroom and I haven’t looked back since. Over the past five years my practice has developed and matured, especially during my three year Bachelors course, where I have honed my techniques and cultivated my own voice."

      p: "I employ the photographic medium as a means of exploring the realms of science and philosophy. I am interested in the origins of the universe, and the planet we inhabit with all its rhythms and intricacies, questioning where our species belongs in this system and using photography’s stillness to fragment reality and investigate time itself."

      p: "Dedicated to the analogue medium, I print all of my work within the darkroom, often employing experimental and alternative techniques to create unique photographs with depth and aura. Through both my practice and my personal work I am constantly investigating how reality can be captured, preserved and transformed through the lens; my images aim to explore and convey how the intricacies of the human form and psyche can be depicted through the visual language of the photographic medium."
