      p: "Alongside my conceptual work I am constantly producing a stream of personal work. Always armed with my 35mm SLR, I love to photograph my surroundings and encounters, and this is a collection of some of the most intriguing and fragile moments I have framed with my lens over the past five years. Embracing a monochrome palette and a high contrast aesthetic, I am curating a collection of still fragments from my own life that I hope will continue to expand and flourish alongside my practice; inspiration is everywhere."
