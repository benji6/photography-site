      p: "A collection of darkroom prints created over the past five years, all via alternative and experimental methods. The camera is a tool I employ to document the world around me, and it is only within the darkroom that I am then able to unlock the true potential of the latent image. By impressing my own visions and emotions upon each image, and embracing the volatile alchemical nature of the darkroom process, I am able to create dreamlike pieces that lay somewhere between illusion and reality."
