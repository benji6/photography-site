      p: "Here lies a collection of deliberately collated individual moments; surreal black and white windows on a world only partially understood by its own inhabitants. Diverse in subject yet unified by aesthetic and process, this body of work is a tribute to the phenomenology of all existing matter. From the rippled silt of a riverbed to the shredded sphincter muscle of an iris, at an atomic level all matter is essentially the same. This notion fascinates me and I believe it is a condition that influences all aspects of life, from the behaviour of the universe and the rhythms of nature, to human interaction and issues surrounding contemporary life."

    {
      p: "Over several months I have captured an array of fragile moments that celebrate the kinetic and intricate nature of life as we know it. Through a cyclical process of shooting, processing, darkroom printing and editing the collection, I finally reduced it to a final set of photographs that I feel collude both the beautiful and the sublime in a clamour of texture, light and form."

      p: "The lapping tongue of a double ended ocean, frothy languid spittle ripples over a coarse bed of sand. Breathing in and out, this boundless body of water obeys the rhythms of a volatile trance; an erratic locomotion that endures whether seen or unseen, heard or unheard. Colossal waves crash against inert rock, effervescent salt water caressing the cracks of this cliff face; a ceaseless pulsating cycle that over thousands of years has etched these deep narrative crags. An uncanny buried scar marks this place, half serpentine half granite, a black jagged line flows south and is lost to the ocean. I am immersed, engulfed by the mesmerising depths of a cool obsidian water, and the world forgets me."

    {
      p: "The elements of this celestial body are quivering and uncertain forms of energy. The dancing flames of a fire that respires, grows and dies; from ashes to ashes they say: everything is cyclic. A body that is all at once fluid, twitching and writhing from darkness into light. Clean cold air fills these lungs and bleary eyes open to the hazy light of day. The origin of all life is a moist mouth, agape and sighing the sundry melodies of a circumvolving world. From light to dark and back again; the hot moist bed of the earth entombs the form. Eyes close and a torrid, dreamless slumber envelopes you."
    },
    {
      p: "A winding bronze river is the spinal cord of this gorge. A synapse in the land snaked with a pulsating body of water whose tidal rise and fall is written in the fluctuation of a lunar form that floats beyond human boundaries of perception. This valley is bathed in a liquid golden sunlight, laced with the heavy pink hue of a dusk that falls sharply… From light into darkness and back again: everything is cyclic. The eyes of this world are unblinking, and its rhythms and cycles shall prevail, with or without me."
